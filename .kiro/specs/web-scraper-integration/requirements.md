# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds web scraping capabilities to the shadcn-svelte MCP server to fetch real component documentation from the official shadcn-svelte website (https://shadcn-svelte.com) instead of relying on hardcoded sample data. The implementation will use open-source npm packages (Cheerio and Axios) to provide comprehensive, up-to-date component information to MCP clients.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an AI assistant using the MCP server, I want to access real component data from the shadcn-svelte website, so that I can provide accurate and up-to-date information about all available components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the MCP server initializes THEN it SHALL fetch component data from https://shadcn-svelte.com/docs/components
2. WHEN live data fetching is enabled THEN the server SHALL retrieve all 47+ available components instead of the 8 sample components
3. WHEN a component is requested THEN the server SHALL return real documentation including description, examples, and installation instructions
4. IF live data fetching fails THEN the server SHALL gracefully fall back to sample data
5. WHEN the environment variable USE_LIVE_SHADCN_DATA is set to true THEN live data fetching SHALL be enabled

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer configuring the MCP server, I want to control when live data fetching occurs, so that I can avoid rate limiting during development and ensure reliable operation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN USE_LIVE_SHADCN_DATA environment variable is set to "true" THEN live data fetching SHALL be enabled
2. WHEN NODE_ENV is set to "production" THEN live data fetching SHALL be enabled by default
3. WHEN in development mode AND USE_LIVE_SHADCN_DATA is not explicitly set THEN the server SHALL use sample data
4. WHEN live data fetching is disabled THEN the server SHALL log the reason and use sample data
5. WHEN live data fetching encounters errors THEN the server SHALL log the error and fall back to sample data

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an MCP client, I want to search and retrieve information about any shadcn-svelte component, so that I can get comprehensive documentation for components like Accordion, Avatar, Badge, etc.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN searching for "accordion" THEN the server SHALL return the Accordion component information
2. WHEN requesting component info for "Avatar" THEN the server SHALL return real Avatar component documentation
3. WHEN requesting examples for "Badge" THEN the server SHALL return actual code examples from the website
4. WHEN searching for components by category THEN the server SHALL return all components in that category
5. WHEN requesting a non-existent component THEN the server SHALL return appropriate error messages with suggestions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the web scraping to be respectful to the shadcn-svelte website, so that we don't overwhelm their servers or get blocked.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fetching multiple components THEN the scraper SHALL implement rate limiting with delays between requests
2. WHEN making HTTP requests THEN the scraper SHALL use appropriate User-Agent headers
3. WHEN encountering HTTP errors THEN the scraper SHALL implement proper error handling and retry logic
4. WHEN fetching components in batches THEN the scraper SHALL limit batch size to 3-5 components at a time
5. WHEN a request times out THEN the scraper SHALL timeout after 10 seconds and continue with other components

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the MCP server, I want comprehensive parsing of component documentation, so that extracted data includes all relevant information for AI assistants.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN parsing a component page THEN the scraper SHALL extract the component description
2. WHEN parsing code examples THEN the scraper SHALL extract all code blocks with proper titles and types
3. WHEN parsing installation instructions THEN the scraper SHALL extract the correct CLI command
4. WHEN parsing import statements THEN the scraper SHALL extract the proper import syntax
5. WHEN parsing component information THEN the scraper SHALL categorize components appropriately (form, layout, navigation, etc.)

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an MCP client, I want the scraped data to be properly formatted and structured, so that I can easily access component information through the existing MCP tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN component data is scraped THEN it SHALL be converted to the existing Component interface format
2. WHEN examples are extracted THEN they SHALL be categorized as "basic" or "advanced" types
3. WHEN component names are processed THEN they SHALL be converted from kebab-case to PascalCase
4. WHEN installation commands are extracted THEN they SHALL include the correct component name
5. WHEN the data is stored THEN it SHALL be compatible with existing search and retrieval functions

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer debugging the MCP server, I want comprehensive logging of the scraping process, so that I can troubleshoot issues and monitor performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scraping begins THEN the server SHALL log the start of the process with component count
2. WHEN processing batches THEN the server SHALL log batch progress and component names
3. WHEN a component is successfully parsed THEN the server SHALL log the component name
4. WHEN scraping encounters errors THEN the server SHALL log detailed error information
5. WHEN scraping completes THEN the server SHALL log the total number of successfully fetched components

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want the web scraping functionality to be modular and testable, so that it can be easily maintained and extended.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the scraper is implemented THEN it SHALL be in a separate module (cheerio-fetcher.ts)
2. WHEN testing the scraper THEN individual functions SHALL be testable in isolation
3. WHEN the scraper is used THEN it SHALL have clear separation between fetching, parsing, and data transformation
4. WHEN extending the scraper THEN new parsing functions SHALL be easily addable
5. WHEN the scraper configuration changes THEN it SHALL be configurable through environment variables
