# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for developing a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for shadcn-svelte documentation. The MCP server will provide AI assistants and language models with access to shadcn-svelte component documentation, enabling them to answer questions, provide code examples, and assist developers with implementing shadcn-svelte components in their projects. This will enhance the developer experience by making shadcn-svelte's extensive component library more accessible through AI-powered interfaces.

The MCP server will be integrated into an empty SvelteKit project, serving as both a demonstration of MCP capabilities and a practical tool for developers. This integration approach ensures the server can be easily deployed and maintained within a standard SvelteKit application structure.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using an AI assistant, I want to access shadcn-svelte component documentation through natural language queries, so that I can quickly learn how to use components without having to manually search through documentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user asks about a specific shadcn-svelte component THEN the system SHALL return relevant documentation about that component
2. WHEN a user requests code examples for a component THEN the system SHALL provide properly formatted code snippets with appropriate imports and usage examples
3. WHEN a user asks about component props or configuration options THEN the system SHALL return accurate information about available options and their usage
4. WHEN a user asks general questions about shadcn-svelte THEN the system SHALL provide overview information about the library

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an AI assistant developer, I want to integrate with a standardized MCP server for shadcn-svelte, so that I can provide accurate and up-to-date information about the component library to my users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an AI system connects to the MCP server THEN the server SHALL provide a standard MCP interface for accessing shadcn-svelte documentation
2. WHEN the shadcn-svelte documentation is updated THEN the MCP server SHALL reflect these updates in its responses
3. WHEN an AI system requests information through the MCP server THEN the server SHALL return responses in a structured format that can be easily processed by the AI
4. WHEN multiple AI systems connect simultaneously THEN the MCP server SHALL handle concurrent requests efficiently

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the MCP server to provide comprehensive information about component theming and customization, so that I can adapt shadcn-svelte components to match my project's design system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user asks about theming a specific component THEN the system SHALL provide detailed information about available CSS variables and customization options
2. WHEN a user asks about dark mode support THEN the system SHALL explain how to implement dark mode with shadcn-svelte components
3. WHEN a user asks about customizing component styles THEN the system SHALL provide guidance on modifying component styles while maintaining accessibility
4. WHEN a user asks about the Tailwind CSS integration THEN the system SHALL explain how shadcn-svelte works with Tailwind CSS

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the MCP server to help me troubleshoot common issues with shadcn-svelte components, so that I can resolve problems quickly and continue development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user describes an issue with a component THEN the system SHALL provide relevant troubleshooting steps
2. WHEN a user asks about common errors or edge cases THEN the system SHALL provide information about known issues and their solutions
3. WHEN a user asks about compatibility with different frameworks (SvelteKit, Vite, Astro) THEN the system SHALL provide framework-specific guidance
4. WHEN a user asks about version-specific features or changes THEN the system SHALL provide information relevant to the specified version

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an MCP server administrator, I want the server to be easy to deploy and maintain, so that I can ensure reliable access to shadcn-svelte documentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the MCP server THEN the system SHALL provide clear documentation on deployment requirements and steps
2. WHEN the server is running THEN the system SHALL include monitoring capabilities to track usage and performance
3. WHEN new versions of shadcn-svelte are released THEN the system SHALL have a straightforward update process
4. WHEN the server encounters errors THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages and logging

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the MCP server to provide information about component combinations and patterns, so that I can implement complex UI features efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user asks about combining multiple components THEN the system SHALL provide guidance on component composition
2. WHEN a user asks about common UI patterns THEN the system SHALL suggest appropriate component combinations
3. WHEN a user asks about accessibility considerations THEN the system SHALL provide information about making component combinations accessible
4. WHEN a user asks about performance considerations THEN the system SHALL provide guidance on optimizing component usage

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the MCP server to be properly integrated with a SvelteKit project, so that I can easily deploy and extend it within my existing development workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the MCP server is installed THEN the system SHALL integrate seamlessly with the SvelteKit project structure
2. WHEN the SvelteKit application is built THEN the MCP server SHALL be properly bundled with the application
3. WHEN the MCP server needs to be configured THEN the system SHALL provide SvelteKit-compatible configuration options
4. WHEN a developer wants to extend the MCP server THEN the system SHALL provide clear documentation on how to add new features within the SvelteKit project structure
5. WHEN the SvelteKit application is deployed THEN the MCP server SHALL function correctly in the deployed environment
