# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to implement comprehensive testing for the home page of the shadcn-svelte MCP server using testing-library/svelte with Svelte 5 syntax. The tests will verify that the home page renders correctly, displays the expected content, and maintains proper functionality. This will ensure that the home page remains stable and functional as the application evolves.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the home page is rendered THEN the system SHALL verify that the page title matches the server name
2. WHEN the home page is rendered THEN the system SHALL verify that the server description is displayed
3. WHEN the home page is rendered THEN the system SHALL verify that the server version is displayed
4. WHEN the home page is rendered THEN the system SHALL verify that the main sections (About, Installation, Usage Examples, etc.) are present

### Requirement 2: Component Documentation Display Tests

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify that the home page correctly displays component documentation information, so that users can see what components are available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the home page is rendered THEN the system SHALL verify that the component list is displayed
2. WHEN the home page is rendered THEN the system SHALL verify that the component categories are displayed
3. WHEN the home page is rendered THEN the system SHALL verify that the documentation statistics are accurate
4. WHEN the home page is rendered THEN the system SHALL verify that components are grouped correctly by category

### Requirement 3: Installation Guide Display Tests

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify that the home page correctly displays installation guides, so that users can see how to install the components for different frameworks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the home page is rendered THEN the system SHALL verify that the installation guides section is displayed
2. WHEN the home page is rendered THEN the system SHALL verify that the framework names are displayed
3. WHEN the home page is rendered THEN the system SHALL verify that each framework has its requirements listed

### Requirement 4: Server Capabilities Display Tests

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify that the home page correctly displays server capabilities, so that users understand what the MCP server can do.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the home page is rendered THEN the system SHALL verify that the server capabilities section is displayed
2. WHEN the home page is rendered THEN the system SHALL verify that all capabilities are listed correctly

### Requirement 5: MCP Tools Display Tests

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify that the home page correctly displays available MCP tools, so that users know what tools they can use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the home page is rendered THEN the system SHALL verify that the MCP tools section is displayed
2. WHEN the home page is rendered THEN the system SHALL verify that all tools are listed with their descriptions

### Requirement 6: Test Infrastructure Setup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to set up a proper testing infrastructure using testing-library/svelte with Svelte 5 syntax, so that tests can be written efficiently and maintained easily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the testing infrastructure THEN the system SHALL configure testing-library/svelte to work with Svelte 5 runes
2. WHEN setting up the testing infrastructure THEN the system SHALL configure the test environment to handle all required dependencies
